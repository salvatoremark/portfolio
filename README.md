Below is a compilation of projects I've developed as part of my ongoing endeavor to master WordPress and React:

### MSALV Create Block Template (WP Blocks 2024)

This plugin template has been crafted using the create-block tool, leveraging Ryan Welcher's [External Project Template](https://developer.wordpress.org/news/2024/04/16/creating-an-external-project-template-for-create-block/) as a foundation. Detailed on the WordPress Developer Blog, this template mirrors the file structure of the create-block tool while incorporating personalized enhancements such as, a PHP class encapsulates the plugin, ensuring streamlined functionality and organization.

### Countdown (WP Block 2024)

A WordPress block designed to integrate a customizable countdown clock, displaying days, hours, minutes, and seconds, dynamically computed from a user-provided date. Users designate a desired target date, craft personalized messaging, and fine-tune stylistic elements through the Inspector Controls interface.

### Latest Recent Posts (WP Block 2024)

A WordPress block originally generated through my external project template, [msalv-create-block-template](https://github.com/salvatoremark/msalv-create-block-template). While the WordPress plugin world hardly needs another "recent posts" feature, this block served as a learning opportunity for me, now highlighting my implementation of various features allowing users precise control over recent post displays.
