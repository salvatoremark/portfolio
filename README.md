### MSALV Create Block Template (WP Blocks 2024)

This plugin is a template, created by the create-block tool using Ryan Welcher's [External Project Template](https://developer.wordpress.org/news/2024/04/16/creating-an-external-project-template-for-create-block/) for create-block. 

This template scaffolds the same set of files as the create-block tool, but with some personal modifications for example, I use a PHP class to wrap the plugin.

### Latest Recent Posts (WP Block 2024)

A WordPress block scaffolded by my external project template [msalv-create-block-template](https://github.com/salvatoremark/msalv-create-block-template), powered by *create-block*. No, the world doesn't need yet another recent posts block, but this block provided good practice implementing many features a user might want to control the display of recent posts.
